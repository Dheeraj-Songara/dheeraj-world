Trains

I like trains.
Let me break it down for you.
You just sleep and do nothing.
No tension of work, neither of home.
No friends or network — time for yourself.
So many, like sooo many different snacks and food come right to your bed for so cheap.
Food and snacks change every 2–3 hours.
I have tried 7–8 different types of buttermilk. I like buttermilk on the train.
Sooo many stories. People come and go. Sometimes the space is full and cheerful or dramatic, and sometimes they just leave and leave the silence behind.
The bed comes with a natural swing.
The motto comes from here, I guess — eat, sleep, and do nothing.
You actually feel you are going somewhere and enjoy the journey, which you can’t in short, domesticated flights.
Moving at such a speed and feeling no gaddha on the road — such a smooth ride.

Before you say it, yes, of course there are some downsides. But every good story, journey, or adventure comes with its salt. And that salt makes your story worth listening to and connecting with people.
