Okay, so there is no real way to prepare for an interview, but you can understand the process of an interview.
It’s basically them meeting you, just like you meet your friends. They ask how life is, what you've done, what you like to do, and what sparked your interest in science.

There is no set of questions that they prepare. It’s just going with the flow.
For example, you say you like neuroscience, so they’ll ask: what do you like about neuroscience, what made you interested in it, tell us about that. What are neurons? How do they work? What is the current understanding of how they work?

And if you are interested in a field, you are usually updated about that field. Like cricket—what was the recent event in cricket, the ICC Champions Trophy, who won, who was the MVP, why people are talking so much about Glenn Phillips, etc.

Second, they look at your aptitude for problem-solving. For example, if you encounter an error on your computer, do you have a logical flow to solve that problem? Do you start by understanding the problem, getting some background knowledge, and then trying to solve it, or realizing you can’t solve it and calling the right person? Or do you just restart the PC?

Third, in case they didn’t like you, it doesn’t mean you’re not fit for it. It’s just about compatibility. Put yourself in the position of the interviewer. You have a bunch of candidates—whom will you choose, and how? That’s a totally subjective thing and differs from person to person.

Fourth, and most important—don’t be a robot. Show them why you like science and whatever you want to do. Let them see the joy in your eyes when you talk about molecular biology or protein biology, just like when someone asks you to describe your mother, father, or lover.

Hope this helps!!
